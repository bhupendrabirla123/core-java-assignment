Assignment -2 

1. Why do languages have data types?
Ans:- The languaes have different data types and they have different sizes , data types are important a data type contains the values that a variable might take.

2. What are the broad 2 categories of data types in Java?
Ans:- The broad 2 categories of data types in java are Premitive data types and Non Premitive data types.

3. What are 4 classification of data types in Java under Primitives?
Ans:-  The following are the data types in java under primitive data types:-
1. Integer 
It is further divided into the following four types:-
1. byte 
byte takes 1 byte (8bits) of space into the memory, it's range is -128 to +127.
2. short
shot takes 2 byte (16 bits) of space in memory, it's range is -32768 to +32767.
3. int
int takes 4 bytes (32 bits) of space in memory, it's range is -2147483648 to +2147483647.
4. Long
Long takes 8 bytes (64 bits ) of space in memory, it's range is -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to +9,223,372,036,854,775,808. To represent Long value you need to provide suffix L ot l.
2. Floating number
This is used to declare floating values. 
Floating numbers are also further devided into following:-
1. Float
Float takes 4 bytes (32 bits) of memory , and to use float we need to suffix with F or f.
2. double
double takes 8 byte (64 bits) of memory , and for using double you do not need to provide suffix becouse the java compiler takes floating numbers by default as double.
3. Characters
char is used to print the value of single characters, it's range is 0 to 65536. When assigning char variables the character is written between single quates.
4. Boolean
boolean takes only two values eigther true or false.

 4.  Why do we say that Java is a strongly typed language?
Ans:-  This mean all operations are type- checked by the compiler for the compatibility. operations that are type legal will be executed and illegals will not be executed and generates erroe.

5. What sub-categories of Integer data types also mention the size?
Ans:- It is further divided into the following four types:-
1. byte 
byte takes 1 byte (8bits) of space into the memory, it's range is -128 to +127.
2. short
shot takes 2 byte (16 bits) of space in memory, it's range is -32768 to +32767.
3. int
int takes 4 bytes (32 bits) of space in memory, it's range is -2147483648 to +2147483647.
4. Long
Long takes 8 bytes (64 bits ) of space in memory, it's range is -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to +9,223,372,036,854,775,808. To represent Long value you need to provide suffix L ot l.

6. Does Java provide Unsigned integers? How do we achieve Unsigned feature in Java?
Ans:-  Java does not provide unsigned integers directly but from java SE 8 we can assign a 32 bit integer value by using Integer class to use data type as unsigned data types. It's range is 0 to        2^32-1.


7.  How many characters can Unicode-16 accommodate?
Ans:-  Unicode 16 accomodates 65536 characters.

8.What two problems Unicode solves?
Ans:-  Following problems are solved by Unicode
1. a particular code value corresponds to different letters in the different encoding schemes. 
2. The encodings for languages with large character sets have variable length: Some common characters are encoded as single bytes, others require two or more bytes.


9. Write five valid and five invalid variable names.
Ans:- Valid variable names 
Name, ID123, String_123, Integer$a, ajaf12dj
Invalid variable names
123_name,  id#,  all@,  if,    while
